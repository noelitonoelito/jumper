= jumper

This project is for the purpose of learning how to make a basic game using
vanilla HTML, javascript, and css. It is a game where a user controls a
continuously jumping character left and right to land on randomly placed,
advancing platforms. If the character falls below the game stage, it is game
over. The higher the user goes, the higher the score.

== code development

This project was created using the free code editor
https://code.visualstudio.com[VS Code].

== images
=== edit image SVG source

Svg images in the `./asset-source` directory were created using the free vector
image editor https://inkscape.org[Inkscape].

=== edit raster images

Although it wasn't really used at the end, the free raster image editor
https://www.getpaint.net/[Paint.NET] can be used to edit PNG, JPG, and GIF
images.

=== favicon generation

Used https://realfavicongenerator.net/[Real Favicon Generator] to help create
some of the favicons and related resources need for the website to support
different browsers/operating systems. It supports PNG, JPG, and SVG sources.

=== compress SVG files

Used the online SVG compression tool https://www.svgminify.com/[SVG Minify] to
make all SVG images as small as possible.

For the best results with SVG Minify, I used Inkscape before uploading to:

. deleted all unnecessary objects and layers from the SVG
. select [Clean Up Document] from the [File] menu
. save as a new SVG with the file type as "Plain SVG (*.svg)"

=== compress PNG files

Used the online PNG compression tool https://tinypng.com/[TinyPNG] to make
all PNG images as small as possible.

== sounds
=== purchase music/sound effects

The sounds used in this project are from
https://audiojungle.net/[Audio Jungle]. You can download watermarked samples of
their sounds to test with and purchase the music after you have decided on what
sounds work best for your project.

=== edit audio files

Used https://www.audacityteam.org/[Audacity]

=== using sounds in JavaScript

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_audio.asp[HTML DOM Audio Object]
