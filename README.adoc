= jumper

This project is for the purpose of learning how to make a basic game using
vanilla HTML, javascript, and css. It is a game where a user controls a
continuously jumping character left and right to land on randomly placed,
advancing platforms. If the character falls below the game stage, it is game
over. The higher the user goes, the higher the score.

== code development

This project was created using https://code.visualstudio.com[VS Code].

== edit image svg source

Svg images in the `./asset-source` directory were created using
https://inkscape.org[Inkscape].

== compress SVG files

Used the online SVG compression tool https://www.svgminify.com/[SVG Minify] to
make all SVG images as small as possible.

For the best results with SVG Minify, I used Inkscape before uploading to:

. deleted all unnecessary objects and layers from the SVG
. select [Clean Up Document] from the [File] menu
. save as a new SVG with the file type as "Plain SVG (*.svg)"

== deploy to github pages

In VS Code's [Terminal] menu, click [Run Task...] and select
[Publish to github pages].

You can also run the following command in the terminal at the root of the
project.

[source,sh]
----
git subtree push --prefix website origin gh-pages
