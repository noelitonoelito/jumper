= jumper

This project is for the purpose of learning how to make a basic game using
vanilla HTML, javascript, and css. It is a game where a user controls a
continuously jumping character left and right to land on randomly placed,
advancing platforms. If the character falls below the game stage, it is game
over. The higher the user goes, the higher the score.
